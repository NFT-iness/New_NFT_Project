        "We then consider the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Who owns NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain? Are NFTs being traded in a bubble? We explore this idea in the 'commerce of NFT' section of the website.\n",
        "- What are the trends in NFT market? What is the growth pattern of this market? We explore this idea in the 'trends in NFT' section of the website.\n",

        "\n",
        "NFTs are one of the most discussed topics recently, as we have all heard about them and it is clear to everyone that it’s one of the fastest growing markets at the moment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Etherium is certainly one of the most famous crytocurrency in which the NFT trades happen and in the project we have to visualise to analyze the sales made on the blockchain and to find which collections are moving the most volumes, as well as to use this information to our advantage when making purchases or sales and some other things.\n",

        "By using an API of Etherscan (a Block Explorer and Analytics Platform for Ethereum) we were able to obtain Transaction Data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Restrictions/Limits:\n",
        "- The provided API has a hyperparameter called \"offset\" which is limited to the value: 10000. Using the maximum value we were able to obtain over 25000 transactions reaching back till 2017. To make a visual analysis more easier to perform we decided to create three Datasets that vary at the \"offset\" parameter.\n",

        "  - NFT Collectibles (exception: we used 15 most popular Collectibles)\n",

The same we want to do with two famous NFT retailers: OpenSea and CryptoSlam and extract tweets that contain the topic \"cultural object\".
